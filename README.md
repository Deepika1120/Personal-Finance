##Problem statement:

In this data analystics project was build a personal finance dashboard in power BI. 

This project can be useful to anyone who wants to track personal expenses, income and financial goals.

##Here are the steps to creating a personal finance dashboard using SQL and Power BI:

1.Identify the financial data to be included in the dashboard. This may include account balances, income, expenses, investment performance, credit scores, and debt balances.

2.Collect the data from various sources, such as bank and credit card statements, investment account statements, and credit reports.

3.Use SQL to clean and transform the data. This involves removing errors, duplicates, and irrelevant data. The data should also be categorized into meaningful groups, such as income and expenses.

4.Load the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI. Power BI is a data visualization and business intelligence tool that allows you to create interactive dashboards and reports.

5.Create visualizations and charts that display the financial data in a clear and concise manner. This can include line charts to show trends in account balances, pie charts to show the proportion of expenses in different categories, and bar charts to compare investment performance.

6.Incorporate interactive features that allow users to explore the data in more detail. This can include filters that allow users to view specific time periods or categories of data, and drill-down functionality that lets users see more detail about specific transactions or investments.


##Some of the most common charts used in finance dashboards include:

1.Column chart: A column chart can be used to compare data across categories, such as comparing revenue by month or quarter.

2.Line chart: A line chart is useful for displaying trends over time, such as tracking revenue growth over a period.

3.Pie chart: A pie chart can be used to show the proportion of different categories, such as the percentage of expenses by category.

4.Scatter plot: A scatter plot is useful for showing the relationship between two variables, such as the correlation between sales and marketing expenses.

5.Stacked Chart:A stacked chart is useful for the total value of a measure broken down by categories in stacked bars.
  Each stacked bar represents a category, and each segment within the stacked bar represents a subcategory. 
  The total height of each stacked bar represents the total value of the measure being displayed.

These are just a few examples of the types of charts that can be used in a finance dashboard with Power BI. The choice of chart will depend on the specific data being displayed and the insights that need to be communicated.

##Impression:

By following this process, you can create a powerful personal finance dashboard that provides individuals with a comprehensive view of their finances, helping them to make more informed financial decisions and achieve their financial goals.
